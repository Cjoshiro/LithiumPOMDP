# Optimizing U.S Lithium Supply Chain Policies Using POMDPs

## Project Overview
In the summer of 2024, I was accepted into and participated in Stanford's Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) where I worked in the Stanford Intelligent Systems Laboratory (SISL). This research project focused on strategically modeling the U.S. lihium supply chain to determine an optimal policy regarding securing a viable lithium supply for U.S. interests through domestic infrasctructure and foreign imports. 

## Contributions
We formulated this problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) to determine the optimal policy regarding lithium mining to accomplish sustainability and supply objectives. We used Julia to develop and design the POMDP model and I contributed to the development of the LiSCPOMDP (Lithium Supply Chain POMDP) Julia package. The package is published [here](https://github.com/mansurarief/LiSCPOMDP) on SISL's github.
